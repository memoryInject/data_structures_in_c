## Installation

Clone the repo into local drive

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memoryInject/data_structures_in_c
```
    
## Usage/Examples

It does require gcc and make in a linux environment to build and run the tests.

To run all test go to the root directory and execute make.

**Note: Ignore the warnings while run the test   

C test created with Unity: https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity 

```Bash
cd data_structures_in_c
make
```

For running individual test, go to specific data structure folder,  
eg: run test for dynamic array go to 01_dynamic_array folder and run make.

```Bash
cd src
cd 01_dynamic_array/unit_test
make
```

Just want to build individual data structure:
```Bash
cd src
cd 01_dynamic_array
make
```
